Author starts putting the year in context, 1984, introducing Newspeak.
 Newspeak was the expression of Ingsoc [English Socialism] and was intended
 to replace Oldspeak.
 Had a vocabulary so constructed that enabled to give exact and subtle expressio
n to everything a party member wanted to express.
 It was done thanks to the creations of new words, but removing a possible
 double meaning of the word.
 For example the word free, you can use is as the lack of something, but
 not as the political meaning as freedom, as the concept itself was removed.
 A child growing up using only Newspeak would never know the secondary meaning
 of the word, and the concept would remain nameless.
 Using this hypothesis Steven point out as how we thing using the words
 only as we need to communicate what we think.

\begin_layout Standard
Some philosopher even think that as animals can not resonate as they cannot
 use the language, so they can not think something like

\end_inset

.
 A extreme view of this is General Semantics, that attacks the lack of specifica
tion in the semantics of the language.
 An example is if John went to prison for 40 years, the grammatics assumes
 that is the same John, but is not, it should be John 1972 and John 1994.
 It happens again with the verb to be, as it abstracts individuals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But this idea is wrong, people adopted as granted as other myths that are
 fake.
 Even when writing we stop as we cannot completely express with words what
 we want to express, or how we could translate if words were attached to
 thoughts.
 Using Monty Python's Flying Circus as an example, Steven marks that there
 no scientific evidence that words equals thinking, instead was an attempt
 to understant something that they didn't.
 Now cognitive scientists know how to think about thinking, so there are
 less tries of connect words with thoughts.

Linguistic determinism hypothesis is linked with Edward Sapir and Benjamin
 Leww Whof.
 They argued that non-industrial peoples were not savages, instead they
 had a different systems of languages, knowledge and culture, as complex
 as ours.
 Whorf took this further, saying that we took our own impressions, like
 a kaleidoscopic where the light passes as a different opinion on everybody.
 This idea occurred when he was working as a fire prevention engineer.
 People had different ideas of what an object was.
 A drum for somebody was empty, meanwhile for another was full of gasoline
 vapor.
 Or a pool of water was really a basin of decomposing tannery waste.
 And there was no error in the example of the empty drum.
 Was not a mistake of the English grammar of if it was really empty, it
 was instead that his eyes fooled him as he could not see the gasoline vapor
 filling it.

 and brown, Nabajo combines blue and green into one word and Russian has
 distinct words for dark blue and sky blue.

Whorf also took Hopi concept of time, Hopi contains 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no words, grammatical forms, constructions or expressions that refer directly
 to what we call 'time' or to future, past or to enduring or lasting
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, basically saying that Hopi had no notion of time being another example
 of how the point of view changes how people think and speaks.

\begin_layout Standard
Eskimo Vocabulary has only 2 words for snow, contrary of the popular belief
 that hey have more than 400 words in order to represent snow.
 This perception of people believing that they have more than 400 words
 was because in 1911 Boas mentioned that they had 4 unrelated word roots
 for snow, but as the time passed, and as it became more and more popular,
 it began to be exaggerated with each retelling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steven continues to show facts of how in the history there has been a tendency
 to compare thinking with language, and how it tests falls as they are not
 that convincing, and using examples of chapter 2 of how this was demonstrated
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many creative people insist that when they are inspired, they do not think
 in words, instead of images.
 Famous novelist and writers says that their act of being the work is not
 writing, instead imagining a visual scene and writing around it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scientists like Tesla ,Clerk Maxwell and even Albert Einstein ideas also
 began in a more geometric thinking, not via words.
 There is an specific example Steven mentions, where you need to do visual
 effort to resolve how many degrees rotated the letter F, as it is not something
 you think in words, instead you do visual work to calculate it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using all this arguments Steven says that we can get new knowledge and think
 without using words or language.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In essence, to reason is to deduce new pieces of knowledge from old ones.Being
 the key the representation that gives the words of it.
 Is not the same saying Socrates is a man as saying Mercedes is a man, it
 changes all that it representes.
 Or reading it from left to right instead of right to left, they have a
 diferent representaition.
 And Steven says that htis representation can also be in others forms, he
 used 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to facilitate it to us, but could also be any physical medium at all, as
 long as the patterns are cosistent.
 In other worlds, it has to use symbols to represent concepts, and arrangements
 of symbotls to represent the logical relations between them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally Steven says that English is unsuited to server as our internal medium
 of computation as it has some problems.
 The first one is ambiguity, as words can have more than one specific thoguht
 about it.
 The second one is his lack of logical explicitness, as English sentences
 do not embody the information that a processor needs to carry out common
 sense.
 He also mentions a third problem, co-reference, as you can be talking about
 an specific man, but you can refer him as various diferents ways

 or only 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

him
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 we as persons can understand that is refering to the same person, but the
 English language does not.
 The fourth one is deixis, that some aspects of language only can be interpreted
 in the context of the conversation.
 Being depended of the context makes also English not good as an internal
 medium of computation.
 A fight one i synonymy, as there many ways to say the same representation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
People do not think in English or Chinese, people think in a language of
 thought and we use language to represent it and transmit it to other people.
 Finally Steven's predictions for 2050 and Newspeak is that mental life
 goes independently of particular languages, and freedom will be thinkable
 even if there's no word to represent it.
 Second as there are more concepts than words, existing words would gain
 new senses.
 Third children would improve the grammar of it and transform it (as in
 chapter 2)

It was really difficult to read this one as they had a lot of words and
 sentences that were difficult to understand, speaking of representation
 haha.
 I really like how he used chapter 2 to argument his theory in this chapter.
 I once took a course of how to read faster and they taught us that our
 mind does not read letter by letter, instead we saw every word and even
 every sentence as a complete picture (also that's why sometimes we don't
 see grammar errors or extra letter on a sentence), in fact making a representat
ion of an idea as he proposed in chapter 3.
 I agree with him in this aspect, but i am not sure about the computational
 one, as i could not get it completely.
 I tried to relation it with my knowledge of languages in computer engineering,
 and is right that we have no ambiguity nor different ways of doing a move
 in memory.
 But we created alias to do it anyways (like c = c+1 is the same as c++),
 being the same as he mentioned of how we try to save in breath, air, time,
 etc, we did the same in programming languages.
